# docparser - extract information from documents using regex

Library to parse semi-structured documents using regular expressions.

A semi-structured document is any text document that doesn't have a strict
syntax, like YAML, but it's possible to build regexes to find specific values
from it.

Useful to parse automated email messages.

To see documentation and examples run `godoc` locally.
